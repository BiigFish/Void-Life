    <h2>Reed Wallander</h2>
    <p>Yesterday we had the largest party I've seen in this city. Daredevil Reed Wallander hosted in celebration of his biggest stunt: to jump into the void.</p>
<p>Everyone in the city was there. Both the circle believers and the lab coats were mingling while the food trucks were selling donuts for outrageous prices.</p>
<p>Reed Wallander stood upon the stage giving a victorious speech of leaving no stone unturned or something like that. The countdown started for the big moment. He stood on the edge of the circle, dressed in a red and yellow jump suit. He had a parachute strapped to his back, a walk talkie, and that was it. He gave one last look at the crowd, and then he jumped.</p>
<p>Everyone listened to the speakers of Reed Wallander's descent. Wallander spoke with energy over the radio that it was dark and he was falling so fast.</p>
<p>Reed Wallander kept talking until eventually the radio signal disappeared. He was too far away for a signal.</p>
<p>Did Reed Wallander find a bottom and safely land? Who could say?</p>
<p>Regardless the party was really fun.</p>
<p>I heard cleanup wasn't so bad either. The city just left the trash on the ground. It was on the edge of the void and would be eventually consumed.</p>
