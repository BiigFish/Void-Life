    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>Food on the edge of the void is surprisingly normal and unchanged. However there is one place that has become a famous staple here.</p>
<p>Donuts.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere various donut shops have started to appear throughout the city. From large donut institutional bakeries to the local donut guy selling from a cart on the edge. You can't not be within walking distance to a donut.</p>
<p>What caused this sudden surge of donuts? Maybe everyone here stopped caring about being healthy. That our mortality appears to be so much more limited as we live on the edge. That nothing really matters and we may as well enjoy the little moments we have today. Enjoy today with a donut.</p>
<p>I haven't had so many donuts in my life and currently I have no regrets. Why not indulge. If it makes you feel good and happy, go ahead.</p>
<p>But the real thing that's getting tons of donuts is the circle itself. Everyday someone sacrifices donuts to the void. Lab coats assure us that donuts are not causing the expansion of the circle.</p>
<p>Maybe everyone in this city can stomach a constant supply of donuts. Everyone here is active, always moving and doing something. &quot;Donuts on the go&quot; is what we say here.</p>
<p>So if you're a donut snob you have to come visit the void. Come quick before we all disappear into the void. Don't miss out.</p>
