<p>I caught one of the lab coats on a smoke break the other day. They were tight lipped but I managed to squeeze out some info from the officials. Turns out, they still have no clue what the void is.</p>
<p>What I specifically learned was that nothing changes the deeper you go. Pressure remains the same. They sent a little drone down via a cable and it's been descending for the past month with no end in sight. It's unexplainable but most are theorize that the void is infinite.</p>
