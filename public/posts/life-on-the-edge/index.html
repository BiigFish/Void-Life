<p>A lot of questions from outside the city enter, but very little response goes out. Is it because its chaos and anarchy inside this city, or is it because we've all already fallen into the void.</p>
<p>Neither.</p>
<p>Living in the city with the circle is actually pretty calm. The people here are less stressed and more accepting. Everyone here is not that worried about the circle. We've accepted our terms with it. I suppose anyone that isn't cool with the void has already left town.</p>
<p>So what do the people do here? Well there's two types of people here: believers and lab coats.</p>
<p>Believers worship the circle, mostly by sacrificing things to the void. Believers vary from extremist cults but also to your daily neighbour who bakes once a week to give to the void. And a lot of partiers who label themselves as believers but seem to just be looking for a good time.</p>
<p>And on the other end of the spectrum are the lab coats. Scientists from all around the world researching the circle. Some are official being backed by the government and conducting researching in the military camps around. Others are the complete opposite, living in abandoned homes and trying to catch something with a fishing rod into void.</p>
<p>And there's also those who are somewhere in between these two major groups. Those who continue to live life normally. I suppose I fall into this category. Though when I hang out with believers they call me a lab coat and when I hang out with the lab coats they call me a believer.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, labels don't really matter when you live life on the edge. On the edge, nothing matters. Its blank darkness does not judge.</p>
