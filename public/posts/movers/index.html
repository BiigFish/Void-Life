<p>About a month ago the new app, Movers, has become quite the popular app on the market. For those of you who don't keep up to date with the newest apps and haven't moved recently, let me give you the run down.</p>
<p>Movers is designed for people that are moving and need help moving their furniture and stuff between places. So you would download the app and send your request for a mover. Your location is listed and others who have the app and are looking for a little bit of coin can accept your request and assist in the move. Think uber but specific for moving furniture.</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering why I'm talking about this app on this blog. Have I run out of stuff to write about the circle? Am I branching out?</p>
<p>No, I'm here today because Movers originated in this city with the circle.</p>
<p>You see, as the circle expands and homes disappear, many people here are constantly needing to find a new place to live and move.</p>
<p>I'm an avid user myself, helping people move their boxes and couches a little farther from the circle. It can be hard work sometimes but it's rewarding and feels good at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Stable jobs here is also something that is difficult, so having the convenience of working a little side gig for some extra money is a nice bonus here.</p>
