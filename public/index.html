            <h2>Life on the Edge</h2>
            <p> A lot of questions from outside the city enter, but very little response goes out. Is it because its chaos and anarchy inside this city, or is it because we’ve all already fallen into the void. </p>

            <h2>Movers</h2>
            <p> Why is moving so damn popular here and how is it affecting the rest of the world? It&#39;s all thanks to a little app called Movers </p>

            <h2>Void Collectors</h2>
            <p> Sacrifices to the void is common practice here. A lot of valuables are just thrown away in the belief that after enough sacrifice, the circle will cease its expansion. But are all of these valuables really being donated in the void, or are they being intercepted? </p>

            <p> What’s more frightening: Riding a hot air balloon hundreds of meters above the ground, or hundreds of meters below? Well that’s a question you’ll have to ask yourself with the new hot air balloon tours here. </p>

            <p> I know what you&#39;ve been dying to know about the city with the giant circle consuming the land. You&#39;re wondering what kind of food we got eh. </p>
