Yesterday we had the largest party I&#39;ve seen in this city. Daredevil Reed Wallander hosted in celebration of his biggest stunt: to jump into the void.

Everyone in the city was there. Both the circle believers and the lab coats were mingling while the food trucks were selling donuts for outrageous prices.

Reed Wallander stood upon the stage giving a victorious speech of leaving no stone unturned or something like that. The countdown started for the big moment. He stood on the edge of the circle, dressed in a red and yellow jump suit. He had a parachute strapped to his back, a walk talkie, and that was it. He gave one last look at the crowd, and then he jumped.

Everyone listened to the speakers of Reed Wallander&#39;s descent. Wallander spoke with energy over the radio that it was dark and he was falling so fast.

Reed Wallander kept talking until eventually the radio signal disappeared. He was too far away for a signal.

Did Reed Wallander find a bottom and safely land? Who could say?

Regardless the party was really fun.

I heard cleanup wasn&#39;t so bad either. The city just left the trash on the ground. It was on the edge of the void and would be eventually consumed.
