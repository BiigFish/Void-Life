I caught one of the lab coats on a smoke break the other day. They were tight lipped but I managed to squeeze out some info from the officials. Turns out, they still have no clue what the void is.

What I specifically learned was that nothing changes the deeper you go. Pressure remains the same. They sent a little drone down via a cable and it&#39;s been descending for the past month with no end in sight. It&#39;s unexplainable but most are theorize that the void is infinite.

**Do you think we&#39;ll ever understand the circle?**

&quot;Of course we will,&quot; replied the lab coat with confidence, &quot;With enough time and effort anything can be understood.&quot;

I don&#39;t know if I shared the scientist&#39;s optimism. It&#39;s been a long time and nothing has been shed on the void. You have to wonder how they stay so enthusiastic with not learning anything in all this time. Maybe they don&#39;t mind accomplishing nothing. Research on the circle is a very profitable business. Perhaps they&#39;re all just doing spins on their stools and collecting those grants and paychecks.

The lab coat lifestyle does seem interesting and mysterious. They reside large shipping containers that are constantly being moved with the edge of the void. The military accompanies them closely but I have no clue what they&#39;re there for. Do they except some kind of alien to appear from the void. Well, I suppose nothing is too crazy of an idea anymore.
