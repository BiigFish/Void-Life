Sacrifices to the void is common practice here. A lot of valuables are just thrown away in the belief that after enough sacrifice, the circle will cease its expansion. But are all of these valuables really being donated in the void, or are they being intercepted?

Introducing the Void Collectors. This small group has been making waves recently. The Void Collectors descend into the void via ropes and pulleys to catch items as they&#39;re being thrown in. Sounds crazy? Well it is, and it gets even crazier.

Their base of operations is a platform about half a dozen stories deep into the circle being hung up from ropes above. Setted up are giant nets that catch people&#39;s sacrifices and take it for themselves.

I talked to one Void Collector on the surface (there is no way I&#39;m going down into the void to their platform).

**It looks pretty dangerous down there**

&quot;It isn&#39;t easy. We lost James the other day. His rope wasn&#39;t secure when he tried catching a statue head. Turned out it was a lot heavier than he thought and it just took him down with it. Poor guy.&quot;

**Why do you risk it?**

&quot;Well it&#39;s perfectly safe if your safety ropes are all in order. Besides its very profitable. The things people are throwing away. It&#39;s insane. Most of its decorative stuff so we just sell it and make a killing.&quot;

It isn&#39;t hard to image that many people don&#39;t look highly at the Void Collectors. Especially the believers of the circle.

&quot;It&#39;s blasphemy.&quot; Said one person as they were draining expensive looking bottles of liquor into the void. &quot;I hope that whole platform of theirs falls in. It&#39;s what they deserve.&quot;

Some believers are now typing weights to their sacrifices to ensure that it&#39;s uncatchable from the Void Collectors. As believers become more aware, will the Void Collectors be able to continue to profit from this new opportunistic business. Only time will tell, and I&#39;ll be the first to let you know.
