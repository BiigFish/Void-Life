A website documenting life on the Edge of the Void.

**What is the void:** A black circle that slowly expands on the surface of the city I live in. Inside is a void of darkness. 

**Why did it appear:** No one knows.

**Is there any hope for the future:** Has there ever been?

**What are you going to do about it:** Write this blog of life on the edge.

**How do I learn more:** Go to [www.voidlife.ratnotebook.com](http://voidlife.ratnotebook.com/)
